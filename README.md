This repository shows the code of my final assignment of the course IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. This is a peer review assignment where I will be asked to create a case study. The case study is about to predict the right location to set up a new supermarket in Berlin, Germany with Geocoder library as well as Foursquare API.
